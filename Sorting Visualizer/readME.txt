# Sorting Visualizer

It is a visualization of different sorting algorithms in C++ with SDL2 Library. 
In this implementation of sorting visualizer, we'll be looking at some of these sorting algorithms and visually comprehend their working.

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts the elements of a list in a certain order. 
We have covered Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort.
The list size is fixed to 130 elements.
Here, all sorting algorithms will sort the elements in ascending order.
The sorting time being visualized for an algorithm is not exactly same as their actual time complexities. We have delayed relatively faster algorithms (like merge sort) for proper visualization.

# Controls:-

WARNING: Giving repetitive commands may cause latency and the visualizer may behave unexpectedly. Please give a new command only after the current command's execution is done.

Available Controls inside Sorting Visualizer:-
- Use 0 to Generate a different randomized list.
- Use 1 to start Selection Sort Algorithm.
- Use 2 to start Insertion Sort Algorithm.
- Use 3 to start Bubble Sort Algorithm.
- Use 4 to start Merge Sort Algorithm.
- Use 5 to start Quick Sort Algorithm.
- Use 6 to start Heap Sort Algorithm.
- Use q to exit out of Sorting Visualizer.
